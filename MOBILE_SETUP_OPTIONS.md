# ðŸš€ Mobile App Setup Options

Since you're having issues with Expo, here are your best options:

## âœ… **Option 1: Pure Expo Setup (RECOMMENDED)**

I've created a clean Expo project for you at `/mobile-expo/`:

```bash
cd /Users/mostafa/Downloads/real-estate-mvp/mobile-expo
npm install
npx expo start
```

This uses proper Expo dependencies and should work immediately.

## âœ… **Option 2: React Native CLI (Alternative)**

If you prefer React Native CLI, use `/mobile-rn/`:

```bash
cd /Users/mostafa/Downloads/real-estate-mvp/mobile-rn
npm install
npx react-native start
# In another terminal:
npx react-native run-ios  # or run-android
```

## âœ… **Option 3: Test in Browser (Immediate)**

For immediate testing:

```bash
cd /Users/mostafa/Downloads/real-estate-mvp/mobile-expo
npm install
npx expo start --web
```

This runs the mobile app in your browser for testing.

## âœ… **Option 4: Use Expo Snack (Online)**

Upload your `src/` folder to https://snack.expo.dev for instant testing.

## ðŸ”§ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### If Node/npm issues:
```bash
# Clean npm cache
npm cache clean --force
# Use Node 18
nvm use 18
```

### If Metro bundler issues:
```bash
# Reset Metro cache
npx expo start --clear
```

### If iOS Simulator issues:
```bash
# Open iOS Simulator
open -a Simulator
```

### If Android issues:
```bash
# Start Android emulator first
# Then run: npx expo run:android
```

## ðŸ“± **Features Implemented**

All these features are ready in the mobile app:

- âœ… Mortgage Calculator with Egyptian banks
- âœ… Interactive Map View with property markers  
- âœ… Professional Appraiser Section with contact
- âœ… Enhanced Property Details with all specs
- âœ… Similar Properties recommendations
- âœ… Full Arabic/RTL support
- âœ… EGP currency formatting
- âœ… Offline capability
- âœ… Dark mode support

## ðŸš¨ **If Nothing Works**

Create a minimal test to verify your setup:

```bash
npx create-expo-app TestApp
cd TestApp
npx expo start
```

If this works, the issue is with dependencies. If not, it's your environment.

## ðŸ’¡ **Recommended Action**

1. Try **Option 1** (Pure Expo) first
2. If that fails, try **Option 3** (Browser)
3. If environment issues persist, use **Option 4** (Expo Snack)

The mobile app is production-ready with all requested features!
