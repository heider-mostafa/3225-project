-- Simple RLS Policies for Auction Tables
-- This is a minimal approach that enables RLS but allows broad access to maintain functionality

-- Enable RLS on auction_properties table
ALTER TABLE auction_properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on related auction tables
ALTER TABLE bids ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE auction_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_verification_auctions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_deposits_auctions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE auction_winners ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- =============================================
-- SIMPLE PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- =============================================

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users and service role
-- This maintains your current functionality while enabling RLS

-- Auction Properties - Allow all operations for authenticated users

-- Bids - Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on bids"

-- Auction Events - Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on auction_events"
ON auction_events

-- User Verification - Allow all operations for authenticated users

-- User Deposits - Allow all operations for authenticated users
